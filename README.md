Scripts and data for studying scaling of PyClaw on KAUST's Cray XC40

To investigate:
- Dynamic loading
- Separate costs of various parallel parts
- Weak scaling
  - 2D, fixed # of steps
  - 3D, fixed # of steps
  - 2D, adaptive stepping
  - 3D, adaptive stepping
- Strong scaling
  - All the same as above
- Single-node efficiency?
